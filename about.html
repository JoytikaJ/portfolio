		<p>
I have always had a predisposition towards understanding logical, analytical, and technical processes.  For my undergrad education, I studied economics, and was interested in the viability of potential economic solutions. I worked in banking and mortgages. My love of logic drew to me law school. I was drawn to the most technical and intellectually stimulating categories: taxation and copyright. Throughout those years, I was dabbling in website development as a fun hobby: I started creating Xanga layouts, then creating Google blogger layouts from scratch. Here, I gained my exposure to Javascript. During law school, I created and coded my own Wordpress blog template. I wanted to make websites that not only functional, but beautiful, and easy for users to navigate and use.

I found myself falling in love with the technical process. I wrote more Javascript. Software engineering has been most intellectually stimulating field of study yet. I took pleasure in solving the series of tiny puzzles, and found it to incredibly addictive. Once I learned the basics, learning which questions to ask the search engine led me the rest of the way. Creating increasingly more complex code projects was my true passion while I supported myself with photography, writing and recipe developing projects. Most days and nights, you can find me writing code.

When I was offered the chance to create the user interface for aquarium. bio, I jumped at it. This allowed me to grow very quickly as an engineer. I learned Ruby, Rails, and Devise library for a thorough understanding of their platform. I became adept working remotely through Github.

Being driven and self-motivated, I work on code-related projects for several hours every day. I am interested in front-end and full stack development, but have repeatedly been told I have a eye for design. I seek out opportunities that will allow me to turn my ideas into reality, learn from other engineers, and continue to grow very quickly as an engineer.
